1. Global Explanation of the Project (Full Overview)
1.1. The Idea Behind the Project

This UX Quest is designed to train you in the user research phase of the design process.
Your goal is to discover the real user problems that happen when people plan or go on holidays with friends — before even thinking about a digital solution.

It’s about understanding, not designing an app yet.
The focus: Empathy, field research, observation, and problem framing.

1.2. The Central Problem

Even though holidays with friends are fun, they often bring irritations, conflicts, or disorganization.
This project asks you to:

Investigate what frustrates people during holidays.

Collect real stories and experiences.

Use these insights to define a clear design opportunity.

1.3. The Full Workflow

This project follows a real UX Design Thinking process:

Phase	Title	Goal
1	Interview Guide	Prepare questions to learn from real users.
2	Run Interviews	Conduct 6 real interviews and collect insights.
3	Affinity Diagram & Empathy Map	Analyze what people said and find patterns.
4	Problem Statement	Define the main challenge you’ll solve (“How Might We...”).
5	Ideation	Generate ideas to solve the problem creatively.
6	User Flow	Show how a user would experience your idea step-by-step.
7	Prototyping	Turn your idea into a paper and Figma mid-fidelity prototype.

At the end, you’ll have a ZIP folder with all deliverables, neatly named and designed clearly (PDFs, pictures, and Figma links).
