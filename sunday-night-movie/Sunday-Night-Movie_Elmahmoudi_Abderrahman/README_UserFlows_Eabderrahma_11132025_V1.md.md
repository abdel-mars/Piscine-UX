Sunday Night Movie – User Flows README
Project Context

Movie 4 All wants to launch a platform that helps users find a movie quickly without spending too much time choosing.
The product team already completed the problem statement and user research.
My role in this phase is to design 3 user flows based on the features defined during the ideation workshops.

Features Covered in These User Flows
1. Filter by Mood

The platform allows users to select their current mood (e.g., Happy, Sad, Relaxed).
The system recommends movies based on that mood.
The user flow shows the journey from opening the platform to starting a mood-based movie.

2. Offer a Selection of 3 Movies

The platform presents 3 movie suggestions.
Users can choose one or reshuffle to see 3 new options.
The user flow shows this sequence clearly and ends when the user picks a movie.

3. Rate the Movie After Watching

After finishing a movie, users are asked to rate it and optionally leave a comment.
The system uses this feedback to improve recommendations.
The user flow shows the steps from finishing a movie to delivering updated suggestions.

Deliverables Included

Mood Filter User Flow

3-Movie Selection User Flow

Post-Watch Rating User Flow

All flows include:

A clear starting point and ending point

User actions in rectangles
